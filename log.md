Today, I uploaded colorconsole99 on GitHub for the first time, version 1.0.0 .
This is my first self-made library, but it is not ready to be released on pypi  :)

You can copy the master file directly to the python Library Directory.

Today, I canceled the complex colors class, which can be called directly without executing "colorconsole99. Colors. [XXX]"

This is only a beta version

Today, I released the colorconsole99 Python library to pypi. You can directly pip install colorconsole99, which is very simple!

Today is an exciting day. Just yesterday, I used my own library, but I found that I couldn't install it because there was a major bug in my program. 

Today, I fixed it and everything was normal! You can use pip to install. It also has a new version number: 1.0.1.1

Today, I have made up my mind to refactor colorconsole99. I have changed the name of this library to clc99, which is more convenient. I have also removed unnecessary libraries and simplified the program structure. I will also upload it again, not only on GitHub, but clc99 will also work on Pypi!
